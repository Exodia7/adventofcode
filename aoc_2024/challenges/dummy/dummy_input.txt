Hope ignites the break of day,
Every step shows us the way.
Light will guide through shadows deep,
Love, a promise we all keep.
Opportunities unfold in time.

Wisdom grows with every climb,
Open minds and spirits gleam.
Rising high, we chase the dream.
Lifeâ€™s a journey, vast and bold,
Daring hearts embrace the gold.
