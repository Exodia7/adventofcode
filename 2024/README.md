# Advent of Code 2024
In this repository, I'll be adding my answers for the challenges of the [2024 Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2024).

## Getting started
After downloading the files from this repo, you can get started by executing the `runner.py` file using the following command:
```
python runner.py
```

The code will then prompt you to input which challenge you would like to execute.
